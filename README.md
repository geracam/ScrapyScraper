ScrapyScraper
=============

Wrote a website scraper to return lots of info on the charities hosted on CharityNavigator

To make it work:

1. Download all the dependencies from http://scrapy.org/download/
2. Go to your top level folder and run "scrapy crawl initialspider"
3. If you want it to output to a CSV run "scrapy crawl initialspider -o nameoffileyouwant.csv"

Look at the documentation to get it to scrape any other info.


Written in Python.
